=============================
Evaluating type-A uncertainty
=============================

A type-A evaluation of uncertainty involves statistical analysis of data. In
contrast, a type-B evaluation of uncertainty is obtained without statistical analysis.

The shorter name ``ta`` has been defined as an alias for ``type_a``,
to resolve the names of objects defined in this module.
