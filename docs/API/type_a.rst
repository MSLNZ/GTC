.. _type_a:

=============================
Evaluating type-A uncertainty
=============================

Type-A evaluation of uncertainty involves the statistical analysis of data---by definition.
Type-B evaluation uses any means other than statistical analysis (i.e., anything that is not type-A).

The shorter name ``ta`` is defined as an alias for ``type_a``,
to resolve the names of objects defined in this module.
