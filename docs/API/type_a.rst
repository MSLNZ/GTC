=============================
Evaluating type-A uncertainty
=============================

Type-A evaluation of uncertainty must, by definition, involve the statistical analysis of data
(in contrast to type-B evaluation, which uses any means other than statistical analysis).

The shorter name ``ta`` has been defined as an alias for ``type_a``,
to resolve the names of objects defined in this module.
